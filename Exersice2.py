# Name of exercise: Faulty calculator
# TO make a calculator that gives wrong answers for following calculations:
#1. 45 * 3 = 555
#2. 56 + 9 = 77
#3. 56/6 = 4

#code start from line 10

#Code words for operators
#additions means plus
#substraction means minus
#divide means division

#Instructions
